# ESP32-TLA2024
A library for I2C ADC chip [**TLA2024**](http://www.ti.com/product/TLA2024) targeted for ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino framework. With minor changes you can use it for other MCUs, as long as you use Arduino framework.

## Using

To use the library for ESP32 development using ESP-IDF:

* Clone this repo under `components` folder
* Somehow you should also include [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) as component as well

To use the library for ESP32 development using Arduino IDE:

* Clone this repo under Arduino IDE `libraries` folder
* Open example provided

## Credit
The library is inspired by [this one](https://github.com/smaug-g/TLA2024/tree/master/lib/TLA2024). Thanks [@smaug-g](https://github.com/smaug-g)!
